## Overview
The Air-Guitar App is a vanilla Javascript/Machine-Learning application that allows the user to strum different chords of a guitar using their webcame.
## How It Works
Click on the link above and allow the browser to access your webcam. A set of four letters will appear on screen that repsentent a different chord. Place your hand on the letter of the chord you want to play and the app will play the desired sound. This app uses hand detection to determine where the hand is in relation to peremiter of the chords.
## Technologies Used
HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Handtrack.js.
## Role
This is a solo project
## Issues
Everything works. The hand detector needs some tweaking so that the hand tracker plays one tone per strum, despite the speed of the strumming.
